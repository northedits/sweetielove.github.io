        Dear Sweetness, <br><br>
        I love you more than anything in this whole entire world. <br>
        You make me the happiest man alive and I truly could not imagine my life without you. <br>
        I wake up every morning and thank the world for putting you in my life. <br>
        You make my days easy and relaxing which is something that I don't think<br>
        I truly had until you were in my life. The days are exciting and have more<br>
        meaning to them since I have had you. I have had some big accomplishments in<br>
        my life but the biggest one will always be asking you to marry me. <br>
        I know we are not officially married yet but it is GOING to happen<br>
        I can promise you that. I know its taken a little longer than expected<br>
        but all good things are worth waiting for. We have our ups and downs but<br>
        we will always make it back to baseline and I am confident in that.<br>
        We will make plans for this year for some exciting things to look forward to...<br>
        I think we both really need and deserve that. I feel like I don't tell you enough<br>
        how proud I am of you and all of the things you have accomplished. Watching you grow<br>
        is one of my favorite things about our relationship and also how much you have<br>
        helped me grow. I am confident we are meant for eachother and I would put that <br>
        on everything. I feel like alot of these letters sound the same but my vocabulary <br>
        needs to expand so that I can truly let you know how much you mean to me and how<br>
        much I love love love love love love you sweetness. XOXOXOXOXO<br><br>
        Love,<br>
        Your Sweetie Love
